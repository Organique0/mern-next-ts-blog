ok, since Heroku wants 5 dollars a month, I have decided to migrate everything to Render since its free. Of course that took me for ever again.
For some reason I had to first compile all typescript files to javascript, delete all typescript files, commit just the javascript files and the then deploy to Render from this git repository.
