mogodb, redis, react, express, typescript, bootstrap. 
There is a new brach where the sessions are stored in a Redis database instead of MongoDB. I just want to keep both since Redis does not have hosting in the cloud.

The most advanced project I have ever made. I would say that is it well build and scalable.
The server side is separated and buid using Express.js and other libraries.

The only reason that I prefer Next.js as a full-stack framework is really just becasuse of ease of use and the fact that Vercel has a great free hosting service.
Here the hosting of the server is a bit of a problem, since I cannot just host the entire project on Vercel.

But on the other side, Next.js is still amazing to use with React on the front-end. 
I would even say that, if you have a React project, you need to use Next.js.
But for server stuff, Express.js is just much better since it was made for it.

Some other tutorial would take shortcuts and rely to much on external services like for example Cloudinary for image upload.
But here the image uploading is done mostly by hand and the images are actually hosted on my server.
Which is pretty cool if you ask me.

I just wish that one day I will be good enough to create a project like this one by my self.
The project seems pretty basic, but I think that it is the most well done one.
I am getting a bit better at Typescript but still strugling at the same time.
Maybe if I would start learning it sooner...
But, no. I did not have time, because I had to play video games and get high. Good life choices there buddy.

My life is pretty bad at the moment, but maybe one day it will not be anymore.
Suffer till you make it I guess.

I just need someone to tell me. 
Is it even worth it for me, chasing my childhood dream of being a software developer, or am I just so bad at it that there is no hope for me?

It is going to take me years to become at least decent at web development. 

But who is going to pay the bills in the mean time?

If I get a job or if I go to some boring school that I don't like I am not going to be able to study what I actually want.

Now, for the first time in my life I know exactly what I want. I don't feel lost anymore. But at the same time. I am scared and anxious and I still hate myself.
My personal opinion is, that I am simply too far gone. I have destroyed my life and now I do not know how to fix it. Everything is broken. I am broken. My brain is smooth as ice. And it is melting. I am 22 years old. And I already feel dead. I have nothing going on in my life. But really I don't care about my life. As long as I have money I say, then I am fine. My mental state does not really matter. I just need to make money first, but make it doing what I want to do and that is being a programmer. The only problem is just that I don't think that I will ever be able to achieve my dream, since my brain is so damaged. I could fix it. It is not beyond repair. But who has the will power to do that? I know exactly what I need to do but I just won't do it, because I am scared. 


Let me go back to studying now.
(We can get high after and play some video games. Because that is what losers do right?)
