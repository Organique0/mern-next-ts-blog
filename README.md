mogodb, react, express, typescript, bootstrap

The most advanced project I have ever made. I would say that is it well build and scalable.
The server side is separated and buid using Express.js and other libraries.

The only reason that I prefer Next.js as a full-stack framework is really just becasuse of ease of use and the fact that Vercel has a great free hosting service.
Here the hosting of the server is a bit of a problem, since I cannot just host the entire project on Vercel.

But on the other side, Next.js is still amazing to use with React on the front-end. 
I would even say that, if you have a React project, you need to use Next.js.
But for server stuff, Express.js is just much better since it was made for it.

Some other tutorial would take shortcuts and rely to much on external services like for example Cloudinary for image upload.
But here the image uploading is done mostly by hand and the images are actually hosted on my server.
Which is pretty cool if you ask me.
